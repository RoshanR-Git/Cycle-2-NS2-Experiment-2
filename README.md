PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE NETWORK WITH CSMA/CD
# NS2 Simulation: CSMA/CD Network Performance

## üéØ AIM
To write an NS2 program to observe the performance of the network with Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).

## üß∞ EQUIPMENT REQUIRED
- PC System with Linux OS  
- NS2 software

## üß™ ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.  
2. Declare the global variable `ns` for creating a new simulator.  
3. Set the color for packets.  
4. Open the network animator file in write mode.  
5. Open the trace file and the win file in write mode.  
6. Transfer the packets in the network.  
7. Create the required number of nodes.  
8. Create duplex links between nodes with delay time, bandwidth, and queue mechanism.  
9. Assign positions for the links between nodes.  
10. Set a TCP connection for the source node.  
11. Set the destination node using TCP sink.  
12. Configure window size and packet size for TCP.  
13. Set up FTP over the TCP connection.  
14. Configure UDP and TCP connections for source and destination.  
15. Create traffic generator (CBR) for source and destination.  
16. Define the plot window and finish procedure.  
17. In the finish procedure, declare global variables.  
18. Close the trace and name files, and execute the network animation file.  
19. At a specific time, call the finish procedure.  
20. Stop the program.
